    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupiter is the second heaviest planetary body in the solar system, right after the sun. Even though its mass is relatively small compared to the sun's mass (it is about 0.001% of the sun's mass), the impact it has on other planets in the solar system is huge. Even now, it attracts most of the asteroids in the solar system so that they cannot come toward the Earth. There was an interesting hypothesis that if Jupiter's mass was about 100 times higher than it was when it was created, it might have started nuclear fusion by itself and evolved into a star instead. If this had happened, the solar system could have become a binary star system which is actually common among many other stars in the universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, we thought it might be really interesting to see what would happen to the trajectories of the sun, Earth and Jupiter if for some reason, Jupiter started the nuclear fusion process and became a star with about the same mass as the sun. We thought the most fascinating trajectory might be Earth's and chose to focus on it in our analysis (but more on that later!) "

    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model we decided to act as though the solar system had only three planetary masses, that of Earth, the sun and Jupiter. This lead to us examining the interactions of six forces which can be seen in our schematic below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Schematic.png\" width=300 title=\"schematic\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This model of the system allowed us to extrapolate a few equations which would make up the majority of our system. All of the equations were based around Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    F_g = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This law was the basis for all of our differential equations for the velocity of bodies in our system. Those equations took this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{F_{1\\;2}}{m_1}+\\frac{F_{1\\;3}}{m_1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers in this equation which are subscripts represent planetary bodies. For example, 1 could represent the Earth; 2, the sun; and 3, Jupiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving forward, it is essential to acknowledge some of the assumptions which these equations and other portions of our model introduce. As evidenced in our schematic, we chose to envision the solar system as if it only had three bodies. While doing this helped reduce some of the complexity of our model, it also makes it less accurate. It is also important to note that we had a bit of freedom as we were creating a model of a system which does not (yet?) exist in the physical space of our solar system. With that in mind, we were able to play with some parameters which have little basis in reality. One of those was the rate at which Jupiter grew in mass. We set it to grow linearly in most of our models, although we did also experiment with having it grow to the mass of the sun as soon as the simulation started as well as having it be as massive as the sun in the initial state. These were all modeling decisions which ended up influencing the outcome of our model (although we can't be sure how much they would impact the accuracy). \n"

It would have been valuable to sweep over a range of values for each thing which we decided to change in our model. It also would have been interesting to see the time that the Earth was flung out of the solar system, since it does that in every simulation. We also could have done more to specify our question and build our model around it. Our question is fairly broad, so making a more exact question which could have been more easily measured probably would have been beneficial.\n",

The first model shown is representative of the first simulation we did and every subsequent plot depicts an iteration on that original idea. We first played with the placement of the sun in the system, then how Jupiter increases in size and finally on the orientation of the planets. "
